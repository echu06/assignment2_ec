## Repository Descriptions

This repository is here to analyze the penguins.csv dataset. We load the penguins.csv dataset using python, and run a few preliminary analyses on them. Firstly, we load in our data, talk about a few of the columns and variables in the data set, and look at some **statistics related to body mass of penguins**. We try to observe how body mass of penguins is fluctuating amongst penguins in different islands and of different species.

Our script first looks at the **frequencies of these penguins** in these **different islands and what kinds of species** they are. We create a bargraph to do this. Then after, we aggregate our data to create **histograms of body mass in grams** for each of the different species of penguins. Lastly, we **aggregate our data** a second time by years and species to see how average body mass is changing per year in the different groupings of species. 

The last lines of code are primarily focused on saving our plots in a pdf for viewing. It creates a pdf file in your directory of the graphs we made in the script. 

To run the code, make sure you have python installed, the appropriate packages, and the dataset in your directory. There is a requirements.txt file in the repository with the packages included and their versions. Simply use the code

pip install r- requirements.txt 

to install all of the packages and their version into your virtual environment. Running the script as normal should be able to generate all of the graphs and save the output to your directory.

This looks good
